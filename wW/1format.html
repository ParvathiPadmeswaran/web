The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for 
documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br> It can be assisted by
 technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such 
as JavaScript.<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
 and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
 of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
 document.</p>
